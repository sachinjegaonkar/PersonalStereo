# Personal Stereo - #AndroidDevChallenge

Digital music become widely available from different media sources like intenet radio, digital storage devices, internet music, DLNA sources etc. With vast amount of digital music accessible to the end users, there is a need of developing tools to effectively and efficiently retrieve and manage the music of interest to them. Audio Processing with Machine Learning models is an interesting topic with many potential applications that we can offer to the end users. With that opportunity, we can provide plenty of information alongside to the end user while playing the right music for every moment.

This personal intelligent music information retrieval system provides below features:
* Automatic Audio Classification/Tagging
    1. It pre-processes and extracts the features from the music samples and creates a metadata for the audio(for latter purpose) and then apply the classification algorithm (Machine/Deep Learning) on it to get the result e.g. genre classification, instrument recognition, artist identification, emotion detection, etc.
* Audio Fingerprinting
    1. Determines the digital summary of the audio e.g. tonal analysis (e.g. melody and harmony) and rhythm or tempo analysis (e.g. beat tracking).
    2. Similar audio samples can be extracted based on the information extracted.
* Audio Recommendations
    1. Automatically recommendes similar search for audio files to listeners.
    2. The music recommendation engine acts on the usesâ€™s past listening history to build customized recommendation lists.
    3. It predicts the listening preferences by using the deep learning models.
* Audio Transcription
    1. Speech Recognition
    2. Lyrics Identification.


Features supported:
  1. DLNA playback, Internet Radio playback, additional music from USB connection, from external devices like smartphone or computer, etc.
  2. One of the unique features - Play Timer. User can set-up the play timer which is programmed to be triggered with automatic playback of pre-configured tracks initially. Further, it intelligently decides what to play next based on the recommendations.
  3. Allows users to browse the music content based on their classification - Artists, Albums, Genres, Tracks, Languages, Contries, etc.


Steps to build the Machine Learning models:
  1. Load audio files - Background task
  2. Extract features from audio - Background task
  3. Convert the data to pass it in our deep learning model - Background task
  4. Run a deep learning model and get results - Background task
  5. Use the extracted information to display the content description - Front End task.
